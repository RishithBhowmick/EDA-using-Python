# Exploratory Data Analysis Using Python

## Introduction

In this notebook, various steps usually performed while doing EDA on a data set are shown.

A few steps that are usually performed while doing EDA are:
1. Analysing the data types of variables present.
2. Basic Statistics of the variable: 
    *  Mean, Median, Mode, Minimum and Maximum for variables that are numerical in nature
    * Calculating the occurences of each of the class for a categorical variable
3. Uni-variate analysis of variables:
    a. Histograms
    b. Box plots
    c. Frequency Distributions
4. Bi-variate analysis of variables.
